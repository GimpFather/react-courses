# Big refreshment of React!

I'm currently trying to refresh as many things as I could! I was trying React a couple of times but always my job requires me to focus more on other technologies. Now I have a perfect moment to reorganise all of the thoughts and knowledge that I learned.

I base this revamp on Udemy and YouTube courses because the goal is to do literally everything - Redux, TypeScript, hooks, tailwind, authorizations with some databases and maybe Next.js! So let's startin' and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svUtlHC2ph4">let's gooo</a>!

Disclaimer for poor `.scss` files. I really like writing styles, but at this moment there are so many more important things to do, so I'm using pre-given styles in 99% of the examples.

Disclaimer for taking this project serious: As I said - I'm using video courses to refresh everything, so sometimes you gonna find repetitive code or static approaches. You shouldn't look at these! 

# Developer part

## Instalation

The project requires: 
- Node 16 or higher.
- Npm or Yarn.
- Sass 1.53.0 or higher.

The project is based on `create-react-app`.<br>
After downloading it install all dependencies `npm install` or `yarn install`. <br>
Then just run `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Build

In order to build application you need to use `npm build` or `yarn build`.<br>
You should also compile `.sass` files, but I didn't make yet a script for that.
